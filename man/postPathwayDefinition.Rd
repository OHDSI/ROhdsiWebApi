will be converted to JSON expression by function and posted into the
WebApi. Note: only limited checks are performed in R to check the
validity of this expression.}

\item{baseUrl}{The base URL for the WebApi instance, for example:
"http://server.org:80/WebAPI". Note, there is no trailing '/'.
If trailing '/' is used, you may receive an error.}
